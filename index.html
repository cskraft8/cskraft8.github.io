Here, I was able to lead a team of developers and student interns to not only support our exponentially growing web of citizen developers, but also to nurture the best ideas from around the globe and help grow them into standardized systems with centralized data via our Power Platform Stage Gate.  We also aided in the creation of pipelines from on-prem data to Azure Analysis Services where we could then develop and train our teammates on connecting to a flexible edge of cloud data, opening the door for innovation from the users themselves.</p></div>

                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/01-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p>BEFORE: Paper forms were being collected from every location around the world where teammates were returning to work. Submissions had to be manually transferred to Excel by HR daily and emailed to corporate where a summary would be compiled. The process was inefficient and slow during a time where this information was critical and time sensitive.</p>
					<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/01a-full.jpg" alt="" />
					<p>AFTER: I created a simple Microsoft Form to completely replace the need for paper.  A flow created in Power Automate was created to store all submissions in a unique SharePoint I created so that only HR teammates had access.  The automated flow also determined if a teammate was denied return to work status based on his/her answers and automatically escalated to the teammate's manager as well as corporate HR. This improved escalation time from several hours down to only a few seconds.  Finally, I created a Power BI Dashboard that was linked to the data sets on SharePoint, and then posted the dashboard on the home page of the new SharePoint so that the Executive Team, as well as all HR managers could graphically view progress.</p>

                                    <p>BEFORE: The management team would post pictures to a WhatsApp channel whenever an issue was found on the floor.  There was no way to formally track accountability and items would frequently get overlooked.  Action items were tracked in Excel for major issues, but there was no central location for all plant related action items.</p>
					<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/02a-full.jpg" alt="" />
					<p>AFTER: I created a quick and simple digital form that all teammates could utilize whenever an issue was discovered.  Shortcuts were added to all phones of the management staff, and QR codes were placed all around the plant for any other teammate who discovered an issue.  Once an image of the issue and quick description were submitted, Power Automate automatically identified the manager of the responsible department and notified him/her that an action item had been added to the board, prompting him/her to assign a champion and due date.  Once the manager assigned a champion, an automatic email was delivered to the champion, clearly communicating the expectation.  The major benefit to this project was that now, no action item could be accidently glossed over.  Each item identified remains on the board until solved, and thanks to Power BI, the management team is able to hold themselves accountable for solving abnormalities in a timely manner.</p>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">Kamishibai Audit System</h2>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">An Innovative Revival of a Once Useful Tool</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/03-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p>BEFORE: The Kamishibai Audit System utilized Excel to aid in the randomization of scheduling audits, but still required a large amount of time and manual entry to maintain.  One large inhibitor to this system was the reliance on paper.  Paper schedule with results recorded on paper and audit failures recorded on failure slips (also paper) added up to a lot of time wasted.  The system was also challenging to police, so participation was low and pencil whipping was common.</p>
					<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/03b-full.jpg" alt="" />
					<p>AFTER: All Kamishibai Audit Cards were digitized into a SharePoint list.  A scheduled flow created in Power Automate that runs every weekday selects 5 random audits and assigns them to 5 random auditors pulled from a separate SharePoint list.  Power Automate then creates variables from the selected audit and inserts them into HTML so that an exact digital replication of a physical Kamishibai Audit Card can be generated and emailed to each auditor.  Once an audit is assigned, it cannot be removed from the Scheduled Audits list until a form is submitted using the Unique Assignment ID.  If an audit is not completed on the day it is assigned, the auditor will get an automatic reminder email every day notifying him/her that the audit is now marked as late.  After 3 days, the audit will be marked as VERY late and the supervisor of the auditor will also be notified via email daily until completed.  A Power BI chart also tracks open audits and is reviewed by management daily.  An additional benefit to this system was the new ability to harvest and analyze data for completed audits.  For the first time ever we were able to view not only the effectiveness of each audit, but also which auditors were adding the most value by identifying issues.</p>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">KPI Dashboard</h2>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Critical Central Hub for Management Team</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/04-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p>BEFORE: Management team brought out their key performance indicators on printouts every morning to management standup meeting.  This meeting typically lasted about an hour due to having to shuffle through papers. Nothing was represented graphically and retention suffered as a result. Metrics needed to be repeated frequently and it was challenging and time consuming to determine how the plant was performing at any given point.</p>
					<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/04b-full.jpg" alt="" />
					<p>AFTER: I created a SharePoint site to serve as a hub for the plant to utilize.  A document library was created and a file for each department’s KPI’s was quickly implemented.  Tables and charts from Excel files, as well as Power BI reports were then added to the KPI Dashboard page that acted as a central performance hub.  A TV was hung at the standup meeting location on the floor and now all management could see the data being referenced by the presenting manager.  When COVID-19 protocol introduced social distancing, the management team was able to seamlessly transition to remote meetings via Microsoft Teams thanks to our already 100% digital reporting format, and the meeting was now reduced to only 20 minutes on average.  This visual representation of KPI’s served as a solid foundation for driving accountability and identifying key opportunities for improvement.  When the KPI dashboard was first implemented, our plant was underperforming and fluctuating between 0-3% GP. 18 months later, we were maintaining a GP of 20%. While the majority of the credit belongs to the fantastic team tirelessly working to improve, the KPI Dashboard was an integral tool for enabling this success.</p>

                                    <p>BEFORE: The Master Quality Log was an Excel document supplied by corporate for tracking customer issues and return dollars paid.  All documents and information associated with a complaint were contained in the inbox of whomever was handling the complaint. Items were infrequently logged because there was no benefit, and financial discrepencies occured at the end of each month.</p>
					<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/05a-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p>AFTER: I created a unique numbering system for all complaints and corrective action reports in SharePoint.  Now each complaint would receive its own folder where all emails, defect images, and documentation could be stored.  Now anyone within the department could work on a complaint at any time.  Once the data was properly structured, I was able to link a Power BI report to create digital dashboards for our 3 major metrics.  The financial discrepencies with our reporting vs. accounting ended and the department went from not knowing what our performance was at the end of the month, to knowing exactly how we were performing at any given time.</p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Automated Accountability and Tracking for New Program Launches</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/06-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p>BEFORE: No system existed for tracking launch performance or action items for new programs awarded to the plant.  Program launches frequently experienced costly errors and new business was occasionally lost due to lack of organization.  Action items that were tracked for high profile programs were tracked in Excel and reviewed briefly once a week</p>
					<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/06a-full.jpg" alt="" />
					<p>AFTER: I created a simple and intuitive SharePoint list for tracking new program launches.  A Power Automate workflow was attached to the list, so that every time an action item was recorded, an automatic email would be sent to the appropriate parties notifying them of actions required.  If an action item is not completed on time, an automatic reminder is sent out daily for each action item.  This dramatically aided in ensuring that critical launch activities were not overlooked.  A Power BI dashboard was connected to the list and reviewed daily to hold each department manager accountable for action item completion.  Thanks to the user friendly nature of the tool, a weekly APQP meeting was set up where all launch activities could be reviewed in less than 15 minutes, all other review could be handled remotely throughout the week via the automatic alerts within the tool.  After successfully launching a few programs, we were able to analyze all the action items and build a standard set of actions that could be pre-loaded at the beginning of every launch.</p>
